# Webpack Config

One of Re.Pack key design goals was to give as much power and control to the developer â€” to you.
This means that Re.Pack doesn't hide anything under its own proprietary configuration, but uses regular Webpack configuration.

## Configuration path

By default, when running `react-native webpack-start` or `react-native webpack-bundle`, Re.Pack will look for Webpack configuration in the following places:

1. `<root>/webpack.config.js`
2. `<root>/.webpack/webpack.config.js`
3. `<root>/.webpack/webpackfile`

Where `<root>` is your project's root directory.

:::info

The paths above are the same ones that normal Webpack CLI looks for Webpack configuration.

:::

If you want to store Webpack config in different place, you can provide custom path:

- `react-native webpack-start --webpackConfig <path>`
- `react-native webpack-bundle --webpackConfig <path>`
- `webpack-cli -c <path>`

:::info

If the `<path>` is relative, then it will be resolved based on root directory detected by React Native CLI, which usually should point to your project's root directory.

:::

## Webpack config template

Every project is different, has different structure, uses different dependencies, has different requirements, so we cannot know what Webpack configuration your project might needs. Instead we give use a sensible and well-documented [Webpack template](https://github.com/callstack/repack/blob/main/templates/webpack.config.js) to use as a base and adjust some bits based on your project.

You can find the template inside Re.Pack's repository here:
https://github.com/callstack/repack/blob/main/templates/webpack.config.js

or copy it from below:

````js title="templates/webpack.config.js"
const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack');
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');
const ReactNative = require('@callstack/repack');

/**
 * More documentation, installation, usage, motivation and differences with Metro is available at:
 * https://github.com/callstack/repack/blob/main/README.md
 *
 * The API documentation for the functions and plugins used in this file is available at:
 * https://re-pack.netlify.app/
 */

/**
 * This is the Webpack configuration file for your React Native project.
 * It can be used in 2 ways:
 * - by running React Native CLI eg: `npx react-native start` or `npx react-native bundle`
 * - by running Webpack CLI eg: `PLATFORM=(ios|android) npx webpack-cli -c webpack.config.js`
 *
 * Depending on which option you chose the output might be different, since when running with
 * React Native CLI most of the values from `getMode`, `getPlatform`, etc. will be filled in by React Native CLI.
 * However, when running with Webpack CLI, you might want to tweak `fallback` values to your liking.
 *
 * Please refer to the API documentation for list of options, plugins and their descriptions.
 */

/**
 * Get options from React Native CLI when Webpack is run from `react-native start` or `react-native bundle`.
 *
 * If you run Webpack using Webpack CLI, the values from `fallback` will be used - use it
 * to specify your values, if the defaults don't suit your project.
 */

const mode = ReactNative.getMode({ fallback: 'development' });
const dev = mode === 'development';
const context = ReactNative.getContext();
const entry = ReactNative.getEntry();
const platform = ReactNative.getPlatform({ fallback: process.env.PLATFORM });
const minimize = ReactNative.isMinimizeEnabled({ fallback: !dev });
const devServer = ReactNative.getDevServerOptions();
const reactNativePath = ReactNative.getReactNativePath();

/**
 * Depending on your Babel configuration you might want to keep it.
 * If you don't use `env` in your Babel config, you can remove it.

## Re.Pack's config APIs

To make Webpack-produced bundle compatible and runnable by React Native, Re.Pack gives you a set of Webpack plugins:

- [AssetsPlugin](/docs/2x/api/node/classes/AssetsPlugin)
- [DevServerPlugin](/docs/2x/api/node/classes/DevServerPlugin)
- [LoggerPlugin](/docs/2x/api/node/classes/LoggerPlugin)
- [OutputPlugin](/docs/2x/api/node/classes/OutputPlugin)
- [TargetPlugin](/docs/2x/api/node/classes/TargetPlugin)
- [JavaScriptLooseModePlugin](/docs/2x/api/node/classes/JavaScriptLooseModePlugin)

Except for `JavaScriptLooseModePlugin` all of them are required â€” not including any of them might break your build on make the bundle crash at runtime.

Additionally to let you use React Native CLI in form of `react-native webpack-start` or `react-native webpack-bundle` commands, Re.Pack gives you helper functions to get arguments project information from React Native CLI and use them inside your Webpack config:

- [getContext](/docs/2x/api/node/functions/getContext)
- [getDevServerOptions](/docs/2x/api/node/functions/getDevServerOptions)
- [getEntry](/docs/2x/api/node/functions/getEntry)
- [getMode](/docs/2x/api/node/functions/getMode)
- [getPlatform](/docs/2x/api/node/functions/getPlatform)
- [getReactNativePath](/docs/2x/api/node/functions/getReactNativePath)
- [isMinimizeEnabled](/docs/2x/api/node/functions/isMinimizeEnabled)
- [getInitializationEntries](/docs/2x/api/node/functions/getInitializationEntries)
- [getPublicPath](/docs/2x/api/node/functions/getPublicPath)
- [getResolveOptions](/docs/2x/api/node/functions/getResolveOptions)

:::caution

It entirely possible not to use the functions above, but **it's highly recommended to leave them**.

:::

If you're planning on using Webpack CLI to run development server or bundle your application instead of relying on React Native CLI, then you might want to look into providing `fallback` values to each of these functions, for example:

```js
const context = ReactNative.getContext({ fallback: __dirname });
```

Those `fallback` values are only used when Webpack compilation is created by Webpack CLI instead of React Native CLI.

:::caution

It's highly recommended to use React Native CLI and `react-native webpack-start` or `react-native webpack-bundle` commands unless you have previous experience with Webpack and you know what you're doing.
