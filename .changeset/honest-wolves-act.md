Override the default `start` and `bundle` CLI commands for enhanced functionality and compatibility with `react-native` versions >= 0.74. Additionally, this update ensures that running `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` will launch the Re.Pack dev server by default instead of the Metro dev server.
