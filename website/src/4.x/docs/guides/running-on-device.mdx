# Running on device

Follow the necessary steps for both platforms as outlined in the [official React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device?platform=ios#running-your-app-on-ios-devices) to run the app on your devices. 
After completing those steps, refer to this guide to set up connectivity to the development server!

## Connecting to development server

:::info 
Before doing any further steps, ensure to be on the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.

To run the app development server, you need to specify your _IP address_ as the host:

<PackageManagerTabs command="run start --host IP_ADDRESS" />

## [Optional] With Module Federation

To run the development server for both the host app and micro-frontends on a device, follow these steps:

1. Modify `your` configuration file (`webpack.config.{mjs,cjs,js}`) to replace `localhost` with your _IP address_ in the `ModuleFederationPlugin` settings for your remotes:

```
new Repack.plugins.ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'host',
  dts: false,
  remotes: {
    booking: `booking@http://IP_ADDRESS:9000/${platform}/mf-manifest.json`,
    shopping: `shopping@http://IP_ADDRESS:9001/${platform}/mf-manifest.json`,
    dashboard: `dashboard@http://IP_ADDRESS:9002/${platform}/mf-manifest.json`,
    auth: `auth@http://IP_ADDRESS:9003/${platform}/mf-manifest.json`,
  },
}),
```

2. Start the host app development server by navigating to its directory and running the command below, specifying your _IP address_ as the host:

<PackageManagerTabs command="run start --host IP_ADDRESS" />

3. Start the micro-frontend development servers by navigating to each micro-frontend directory and running the command below, specifying your _IP address_ as the host:

<PackageManagerTabs command="run start --host IP_ADDRESS" />
